####There are many procedures and functions built into
####Python without any prerequisites needed. A simple example is print.
####Modules ( or Libraries) are collections of extra, pre-written functions and procedures.
####These are available to use, but we need to import them into our code at the start.

import math

number = float(input("Enter a number:"))
answer = math.sqrt(number)

print(answer)
